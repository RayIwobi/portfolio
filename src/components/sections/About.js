            My journey as a software developer is rooted in a strong foundation of real‑world IT 
              experience and a continuous drive to evolve with technology. I began my professional 
              career as an IT Specialist, spending over seven years in the banking sector, 
              where I gained deep exposure to enterprise systems, infrastructure, security, and 
              mission‑critical operations. This period shaped my discipline, attention to detail, 
              and problem‑solving mindset.<br/><br/>

              I later advanced into leadership roles, working as an IT Manager in a healthcare 
              center and subsequently as an IT Supervisor in an audit firm. These roles 
              strengthened my ability to manage systems, support diverse users, and align technology 
              with business and compliance needs.<br/><br/>

              In 2016, I transitioned into web development, driven by a desire to build 
              user‑facing solutions rather than only manage systems. I started with HTML, CSS, 
              Adobe ActionScript, Python, Django and database technologies like MySql, Sqlite, PostgreSQL 
              and soon began building dynamic websites and applications using 
              WordPress, delivering visually appealing and functional solutions for real‑world use 
              cases.<br/><br/>

              As web technologies evolved, so did my skill set. Today, I work as a MERN Stack Developer, 
              building full‑stack applications with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I focus on 
              creating scalable, secure, and user‑centric applications, integrating modern authentication, 
              APIs, databases, and payment systems.<br/><br/>

              What sets me apart is my unique blend of enterprise IT experience and modern software development 
              skills. I approach development not just as coding, but as crafting reliable solutions that meet 
              both technical and business goals. My journey continues to be driven by learning, building, and 
              delivering impactful software.
